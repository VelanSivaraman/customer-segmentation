# customer-segmentation
Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics, aiming to divide customers into groups based on their similarities. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for segmentation tasks.
# Steps Involved:

Data Collection: Gather relevant customer data such as demographics, purchase history, browsing behavior, etc.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling if necessary.

Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for segmentation.

Determining the Number of Clusters: Use techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Applying K-means: Run the K-means algorithm on the dataset.

Interpretation: Analyze the resulting clusters and assign meaningful labels to them.

Visualization: Visualize the clusters to understand the customer segments better.
